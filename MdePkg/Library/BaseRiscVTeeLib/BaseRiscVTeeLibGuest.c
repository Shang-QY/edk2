  Guest shares a memory region

  Initiates the assignment-change of TVM physical address space starting at TvmGpaAddr from
  confidential to non-confidential/shared memory. The requested range must lie within an existing
  region of confidential address space, and may or may not be populated. If the region of address
  space is populated, the TSM invalidates the pages and marks the region as pending assignment
  change to shared. The host must complete a TVM TLB invalidation sequence, initiated by
  SbiTeeHostTvmFence(), in order to complete the assignment-change. The calling TVM vCPU is
  considered blocked until the assignment-change is completed; attempts to run it with
  SbiTeeHostRunTvmVcpu() will fail. Any guest page faults taken by other TVM vCPUs in this region prior to
  completion of the assignment-change are considered fatal. The host may not insert any pages in the
  region prior to completion of the assignment-change. Upon completion, the host may reclaim the
  confidential pages that were previously mapped in the region using SbiTeeHostReclaimPages()
  and may insert shared pages into the region using SbiTeeHostAddTvmSharedPages(). If the range of
  address space is completely unpopulated, the region is immediately mapped as shared and the host
  may insert shared pages.
